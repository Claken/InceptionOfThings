This group project consists of setting up several environments under specific rules.

# 👩🏻‍🏫 WHAT THIS PROJECT BROUGHT ME
- With this project, I saw some notions of kubernetes, in particular K3d and K3s.
- I learned how to use Vagrant to manage the lifecycle of virtual machines, and Vagrantfile to configure virtual machines.

# P1 : K3s and Vagrant

For this part, we had to set up 2 machines :
- the Server
- the ServerWorker

# P2 : K3s and three simple applications

For this part, we had to set up only one machine with three applications. <br/>
We used [NGINX](https://nginx.org/en/) for the three of them.

# P3 : K3d and Argo CD
